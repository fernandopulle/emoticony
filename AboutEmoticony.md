## Introduction ##
Emoticony is a Google Wave robot which replaces text characters with images.

## Interacting With Emoticony ##
You can add Emoticony to any wave by adding emoticonbot@appspot.com

Emoticony, will only react when the corresponding text is found in an edited, or newly submitted blip after it becomes a participant. For this reason it is recommended Emoticony is one of the first participants you add.
It is hoped in a later version, Emoticony will be able to go back through all content already present within the Wave when it is added.
